# Muon Example Project (for muCon)

This repository enables working with all the services in a single place.

Currently, this is source code oriented. For a real system, it would be expected to split these
into their own repositories and work in a more artifact oriented way.

## Start up

*Pre-requisites*

You need the following installed and working :-

* Java, 8+
* Node/ NPM, recommend 6.8
* Docker
* Docker Compose
* Make

It is recommended to install the Muon cli, which is a npm module

```
npm install -g muon-cli
```

*Startup*

This runs up the entire stack. It uses docker-compose for orchestrating the processes.

```
make
```

You can use docker-compose directly to stop different services to enable local development.

Eg, to perform ui dev, you would run ```make``` and then run

```
docker-compose stop ui
```

Then, you can start the ui service in your IDE, running against the rabbit server that the environment runs up and has against the local environment.

## Data Flows

There are two primary event data flows. Product Creation and Basket maintenance

Product data is added via the event (this is the standard Muon event schema)

```
{
	"event-type": "ProductAdded",
	"schema": "http://www.simplicityitself.io/mucon/product/1",
	"stream-name": "products",
	"service-id": "creating-service",
	"payload": {
		"product-name": "First Data",
		"product-id": "123456789",
		"description": "Hello World"
	}
}
```

You can add a product using the muon cli

```
muon event '{ "event-type": "ProductAdded", "schema": "http://www.simplicityitself.io/mucon/product/1","stream-name": "products","service-id": "creating-service","payload": {"product-name": "First Data","product-id": "123456789","description": "Hello World"}}'
```

Baskets are updated with the following event

```
{
	"event-type": "BasketProductModified",
	"schema": "http://www.simplicityitself.io/mucon/basket/1",
	"stream-name": "basket",
	"service-id": "creating-service",
	"payload": {
		"user-id": "123",
		"product-id": "123456789",
		"quantity-added": 3
	}
}
```

You can add an item to a users basket, by emitting the event

```
muon event '{"event-type": "BasketProductModified","schema": "http://www.simplicityitself.io/mucon/basket/1","stream-name": "basket","service-id": "creating-service","payload": {"user-id": "123", "product-id": "123456789","quantity-added": 3}}'
```

The `quantity-added` field is expected to also be negative.

You can add these

## Services

This consists of a few services, implementing the very basics of an online shop, with supporting infrastructure services.

### Support

Running are :-

* RabbitMQ - for communication and discovery
* Photon - For event persistence
* Molecule - a management web UI


To interact with the running services, you can use the Muon CLI

```
> export MUON_URL=amqp://muon:microservices@localhost <1>
> muon discover      <2>


> muon introspect product-page   <3>
> muon event            <4>
```
<1> Set the discovery location to tbe the AMQP server running here
<2> Execute a discovery, see what's running locally. (also `muon disco`, `muon d` etc)
<3> Introspect the service `product-page`. See what capabilities it has
<4> Emit an event. This is persisted into the local event store, Photon.

### Application Services

The actual application is made up of several cooperating services, fronted by a very simple Muon.js + React
user interface.

#### Product Search

Reads all product creation events, pushes them into an internal elastic search instance and
presents a search interface on top of them using rpc.

```
muon rpc rpc://product-search/search '{"text":"blue"}'
```

This services also has a basic 'continuous search' facility, using the reactive stream protocol

```
muon stream stream://product-search/search '{"text":"blue"}'
```

You will receive an update whenever a new product event is read in (your search may not actually change).


#### Product Page microservice

A service that is able to run fully autonomously to render the product page in the shop.
Contains full product specs, cross sell and active basket size counts.

#### UI

A simple React JS UI using Muon.js imported as a minified JS file

Muon.js can also be used when imported as a NPM module and run through webpack or browserify
